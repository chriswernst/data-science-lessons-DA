### Agenda

**1.** Learning Objectives for 2018

- Programming with Python (built-ins, keywords)
- NumPy with Python
- Use Pandas to handle Excel Files
- Web scraping with python (Requests / Beautiful Soup Module)
- Connect Python to SQL
- Use matplotlib and seaborn for data visualizations
- Use plotly for interactive visualizations
- Machine Learning with SciKit Learn and others
	- Linear Regression
	- K Nearest Neighbors
	- K Means Clustering
	- Natural Language Processing
	- Neural Nets and Deep Learning

A course I suggest you enroll in, for ongoing learning, in between sessions: https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/
(May be a bit advanced to do alone, but I can help clarify sections, and explain more complex topics in Machine Learning. This course will help you get up to speed with basic Python foundations, so we can focus on Statistics and Machine Learning during our sessions)

We will use hackerRank for proficiency testing; [see here for an example.](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/py-hello-world/problem)

**2.** Python Crash Course (see data-science-lessons-DA/Third_Lesson/variables_operators_keywords.py)

- basics (variables, operators, datatypes)
- built-ins
- keywords
- libraries
- functions

**HOMEWORK**
 Python Crash Course (Sections 1-4 of "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning") - bring questions to the next session!
Try to keep a list of items that are confusing / unclear for us to discuss
